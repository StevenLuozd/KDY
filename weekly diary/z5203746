  In week1, we formed our group and communicated with each other. After discussion, we selected the third projectâ€”an 
  accommodation booking web as our final project. We distributed some work for each members and I found some relative 
  resources about CSS and React for creating a website also i watched some reference videos to understand more about this 
  project.

Week 3:
  Our team allocated prototype for our front-end team and we finished it. I am mainly responsible for draw prototype 
  on my ipad according to some suggestions from my group members and we discuss and adjust it and finish it. 
  On the other hand, I wrote two of epics for our project proposal and gave some suggestions for the final proposal, 
  and also I watched some videos about react and website building.
